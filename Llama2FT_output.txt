Create a new API with name as "ExtractEntityFromDefectSummary" and provide the result in json format containing ["Entity", "Label"] related to Automotive industry from data.\n11.   Call the API from Automotive industry defect summary data and check the result in json format containing ["Entity", "Label"] related to Automotive industry from data.\n12.   Check the result from step 11 and ensure that the result is in json format containing ["Entity", "Label"] related to Automotive industry from data.\n\nSteps 1 to 12 are the automation testing steps to extract the entities related to Automotive industry from defect summary data. The result will be in json format containing ["Entity", "Label"] related to Automotive industry from data.'}
